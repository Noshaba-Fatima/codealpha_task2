# 📘 Unemployment Analysis using Python

## 📌 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing unemployment rate (%) data to understand overall trends, seasonal patterns, and the impact of COVID‑19. Using Python, the analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory visualizations, time‑series insights, and policy‑relevant interpretations.


 🚀 Project Workflow

 1️⃣ Dataset Loading

* Imported unemployment dataset (CSV)
* Parsed date column and structured the data for time-series analysis

 2️⃣ Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values
* Converted date formats

 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Trend analysis using line plots
* Rolling averages (3‑month & 12‑month)
* Seasonal patterns across months/years
* Summary statistics

 4️⃣ COVID‑19 Impact Analysis

* Compared pre‑COVID vs COVID unemployment levels
* Identified spikes and recovery periods
* Used basic time-series modeling to detect shifts during COVID

 5️⃣ Key Insights & Patterns

* Changes in unemployment rates before/during/after COVID
* Seasonality trends (peak and low months)
* Long-term movement of unemployment rate



📊 Results (Template)

* COVID period shows a significant rise in unemployment (e.g., **X% → Y%**)
* Seasonal peaks observed in April, lows in July
* Post‑COVID decline but rates remain above pre‑pandemic levels


 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
